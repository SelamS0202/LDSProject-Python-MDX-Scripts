The Python scripts were developed to extract data from given CSV files (sales data for three product lines: GPU, CPU, and RAM; geography data; sales period data; and vendor data) and 
ingest it into the respective tables to build a data warehouse based on a fact constellation schema. 
The dimensions include Time, Geography, Vendor, and Product, all designed for a data mining project.
